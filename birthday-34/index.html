      Baby, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad When I’m gone but I’m trying to give you the life that I never had I can see you’re
      sad, even when you smile even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes deep inside, you wanna cry Cause you’re scared I ain’t there, Daddy’s
      with you in your prayers No more cryin wipe them tears, Daddy’s here no more nightmares We gonna pull together through it we gonna do it Lainie,
      uncle’s crazy ain’t he, yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it We’re all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls When it
      whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls Lookin puzzled, in a daze I know it’s confusing you Daddy’s always on the move, Mama’s always
      on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me All the
      things, growin up as daddy that he had to see Daddy don’t want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way
      your mother and me But things have got so bad between us I don’t see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be like when was
      teenagers but then of course everything always happen for a reason I guess it was never meant to be but it’s just something we have no control
      over And that’s what destiny is, but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we’ll wake up and this will all just be a
      dream. It’s funny, I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up and stuck em under the tree and
      said some of em were from me cause daddy couldn’t buy em I’ll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin Cause daddy felt like a
      bum, see Daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept
      getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block And your mom, was saving money for you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you So
      you could go to college, almost had a thousand dollars Till someone broke in and stole it and I know it hurt so bad it broke your mamma’s heart
      And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart Mom and dad was arguing a lot so mama moved back on the chalmers in a flat One
      bedroom apartment and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novara And that’s when Daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre
      and flew you and Mama out to see me But daddy had to work, you and mama had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the TV, and mama didn’t
      like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it That Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit And it all happened too fast
      for either one of us to grab it I’m just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you
      proud Now I’m sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out To see how much you both have
      grown, it’s almost like your sisters now Wow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy’s still here Lainie I’m talking to you too, Daddy’s still
      here I like the sound of that, yeah it’s got a ring to it, don’t it? Shhh, mama’s only gone for the moment.
